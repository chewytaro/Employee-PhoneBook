# Description:
 The goal of this project was to create a simple CLI for clients to be able to easily look up the information of their employees and also add more and more whenever needed. 

# Installation: 
   In whatever IDE terminal that you use, clone the repo into that IDE terminal. Then, seed the data by starting mysql in the db folder by typing in this into the command line: "mysql -u root -p". After entering your password and mysql starts up, seed both folders by doing: "source schema.sql" and also "source seeds.sql". After successfully updating, in the root part of you folder, start the program by running "node prompt.js"

# Usage:
  Run "node prompt.js" to start the program, then a list of options will appear allowing you to choose what you want to do with the database. A full video example here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XyYc8pIwPYUgA4k4G3fwZVKarxLdsg6p/view
